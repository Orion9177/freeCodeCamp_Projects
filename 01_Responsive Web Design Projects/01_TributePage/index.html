            <p>
                Gandalf is a protagonist in J. R. R. Tolkien's novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. He is a
                wizard, one of the Istari order, and the leader and mentor of the Fellowship of the Ring. Tolkien took
                the name "Gandalf" from the Old Norse "Catalogue of Dwarves" (Dvergatal) in the Völuspá.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a wizard and the bearer of a Ring of Power, Gandalf has great power, but works mostly by encouraging
                and persuading. He sets out as Gandalf the Grey, possessing great knowledge, and travelling continually,
                always focused on the mission to counter the Dark Lord Sauron. He is associated with fire, his ring
                being Narya, the Ring of Fire, and he both delights in fireworks to entertain the hobbits of the Shire,
                and in great need uses fire as a weapon. As one of the Maiar he is an immortal spirit, but being in a
                physical body on Middle-earth, he can be killed in battle, as he is by the Balrog from Moria. He is sent
                back to Middle-earth to complete his mission, now as Gandalf the White and leader of the Istari.
            </p>
            <h3>Fictional biography</h3>
            <h4>Valinor</h4>
            <p>
                In Valinor, Gandalf was called Olórin. He was one of the Maiar of Valinor, specifically, of the people
                of the Vala Manwë; and was said to be the wisest of the Maiar. He was also closely associated with two
                other Valar: Irmo, in whose gardens he lived, and Nienna, the patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage.
                When the Valar decided to send the order of the Wizards (Istari) across the Great Sea to Middle-earth in
                order to counsel and assist all those who opposed Sauron, Olórin was proposed by Manwë. Olórin initially
                begged to be excused as he feared Sauron and lacked the strength to face him, but Manwë replied that
                that was all the more reason for him to go.
            </p>
            <p>
                As one of the Maiar, Gandalf was not a mortal Man but an angelic being who had taken human form. As one
                of those spirits, Olórin was in service to the Creator (Eru Ilúvatar) and the Creator's 'Secret Fire'.
                Along with the other Maiar who entered into the world as the five Wizards, he took on the specific form
                of an aged old man as a sign of his humility. The role of the wizards was to advise and counsel but
                never to attempt to match Sauron's strength with their own, and hopefully the kings and lords of
                Middle-earth would be more receptive to the advice of a humble old man than a more glorious form giving
                them direct commands.
            </p>
            <h4>Middle-Earth</h4>
            <p>
                The Istari arrived in Middle-earth separately, early in the Third Age; Gandalf was the last, landing in
                the Havens of Mithlond. He seemed the oldest and least in stature, but Círdan the Shipwright felt that
                he was the greatest on their first meeting in the Havens, and gave him Narya, the Ring of Fire. Saruman,
                the chief Wizard, learned of the gift and resented it. Gandalf hid the ring well, and it was not widely
                known until he left with the other ring-bearers at the end of the Third Age that he, and not Círdan, was
                the holder of the third of the Elven-rings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gandalf's relationship with Saruman, the head of their Order, was strained. The Wizards were commanded
                to aid Men, Elves, and Dwarves, but only through counsel; it was forbidden to use force to dominate
                them—an injunction that Saruman increasingly disregarded.
            </p>
            <h5>The White Council</h5>
            <p>
                Gandalf suspected early on that an evil presence, the Necromancer of Dol Guldur, was not a Nazgûl but
                Sauron himself. He went to Dol Guldur to discover the truth, but the Necromancer withdrew before
                him. The Necromancer returned to Dol Guldur with greater force, and the White Council was formed in
                response. Galadriel had hoped Gandalf would lead the council, but he refused, declining to be bound
                by any but the Valar who had sent him. Saruman was chosen instead, as the most knowledgeable about
                Sauron's work in the Second Age.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gandalf returned to Dol Guldur "at great peril" and learned that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron
                returned. The following year the White Council was summoned, and Gandalf urged that Sauron be driven
                out. Saruman, however, reassured the Council that Sauron's evident effort to find the One Ring
                would fail, as the Ring would long since have been carried by the river Anduin to the Sea; and the
                matter was allowed to rest. But at this time, Saruman himself began actively seeking the Ring near the
                Gladden Fields where Isildur had been killed.
            </p>
            <h5>The Quest of Erebor</h5>
            <p>
                "The Quest of Erebor" in Unfinished Tales elaborates upon the story behind The Hobbit. It tells of a
                chance meeting between Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield, a Dwarf-king in exile, in the inn of the Prancing
                Pony in Bree. Gandalf had for some time foreseen the coming war with Sauron, and knew that the North was
                especially vulnerable. If Rivendell were to be attacked, the dragon Smaug could cause great devastation.
                He persuaded Thorin that he could help him regain his lost territory of Erebor from Smaug, and so the
                quest was born.
            </p>
            <h4>The Hobbit</h4>
            <p>
                Gandalf meets with Bilbo in the opening of The Hobbit. He arranges for a tea party, to which he also
                invites the thirteen dwarves and thus arranges the traveling group central to the novel's narrative.
                Gandalf contributes the map and key to Erebor to assist the quest. On this quest Gandalf finds his
                sword, Glamdring, in a troll's treasure hoard. Elrond informs them this sword was made in Gondolin, a
                city where Elrond's father lived as a child before its destruction.
            </p>
            <p>
                After escaping from the Misty Mountains pursued by goblins and wargs, the party is carried to safety by
                the Great Eagles. Gandalf then persuades Beorn to house and provision the company for the trip
                through Mirkwood. Gandalf leaves the company before they enter Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing
                business to attend to.
            </p>
            <p>
                He turns up again, however, before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old man, revealing himself when
                it seems the Men of Esgaroth and the Mirkwood Elves will fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug's
                treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensues when hosts of goblins and wargs attack all three parties.
                After the battle, Gandalf accompanies Bilbo back to the Shire, revealing at Rivendell what his
                pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the council to evict Sauron, since quite
                evidently Sauron did not require the One Ring to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood. Then the
                Council "put forth its power" and drives Sauron from Dol Guldur. Sauron, however, has anticipated this
                and withdraws as a feint, only to reappear in Mordor.
            </p>
            <h4>The Lord of the Rings</h4>
            <p>
                As explained in The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf spends the years between The Hobbit and The Lord of
                the Rings traveling Middle-earth in search of information on Sauron's resurgence and Bilbo Baggins's
                mysterious ring, spurred particularly by Bilbo's initial misleading story of how he had obtained it as a
                "present" from Gollum. During this period, he befriends Aragorn and first becomes suspicious of Saruman.
                He spends as much time as he can in the Shire, strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and Frodo,
                Bilbo's orphaned cousin and adopted heir.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gandalf returns to the Shire for Bilbo's "eleventy-first" (111th) birthday party, bringing many
                fireworks for the occasion. After Bilbo, as a prank on his guests, puts on the Ring and disappears,
                Gandalf strongly encourages his old friend to leave the ring to Frodo, as they had planned. Bilbo
                becomes hostile and accuses Gandalf of trying to steal the ring. Alarmed, Gandalf impresses on Bilbo the
                foolishness of this accusation. Coming to his senses, Bilbo admits that the ring has been troubling him,
                and leaves it behind for Frodo as he departs for Rivendell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the next 17 years, Gandalf travels extensively, searching for answers on the ring. He finds some
                answers in Isildur's scroll, in the archives of Minas Tirith. He also wants to question Gollum, who had
                borne the ring for many years. Gandalf searches long and hard for Gollum, and often has the assistance
                of Aragorn. Aragorn eventually succeeds in finding Gollum. Gandalf questions Gollum, threatening him
                with fire when he proves unwilling to speak. Gandalf learns that Sauron has forced Gollum under torture
                in Barad-dûr to tell what he knows of the ring. This reinforces Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's
                ring is the One Ring.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Returning to the Shire, Gandalf confirms his suspicions by throwing the Ring into Frodo's hearth-fire
                and reading the writing that appears on the Ring's surface. He tells Frodo the history of the Ring, and
                urges him to take it to Rivendell, for he will be in grave danger if he stays in the Shire. Gandalf says
                he will attempt to return for Frodo's 50th birthday party, to accompany him on the road; and that
                meanwhile Frodo should arrange to leave quietly, as the servants of Sauron will be searching for him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside the Shire, Gandalf encounters Radagast the Brown, another wizard, who brings the news that the
                Nazgûl have ridden forth out of Mordor—and a request from Saruman that Gandalf come to Isengard. Gandalf
                leaves a letter to Frodo (urging his immediate departure) with Barliman Butterbur at an inn in Bree, and
                heads towards Isengard. There Saruman reveals his true intentions, urging Gandalf to help him obtain the
                Ring for his own use. Gandalf refuses, and Saruman imprisons him at the top of his tower. Eventually
                Gandalf is rescued by Gwaihir the Eagle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gwaihir sets Gandalf down in Rohan, where Gandalf appeals to King Théoden for a horse. Théoden, under
                the evil influence of Gríma Wormtongue, Saruman's spy and servant, tells Gandalf to take any horse he
                pleases, but to leave quickly. It is then that Gandalf meets the great horse Shadowfax, one of the
                mearas, who will be his mount and companion for much of the Lord of the Rings. Gandalf then rides hard
                for the Shire, but does not reach it until Frodo has already set out. Knowing that Frodo and his
                companions will be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf makes his own way there. He learns at Bree that the
                Hobbits have fallen in with Aragorn. He faces the Nazgûl at Weathertop but escapes after an all-night
                battle, drawing four of them northward. Frodo, Aragorn and company face the remaining five on
                Weathertop a few nights later. Gandalf reaches Rivendell just before Frodo's arrival.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Rivendell, Gandalf helps Elrond drive off the Nazgûl pursuing Frodo and plays a great part in the
                following council as the only person who knows the full history of the Ring. He also reveals that
                Saruman has betrayed them and is in league with Sauron. When it is decided that the Ring has to be
                destroyed, Gandalf volunteers to accompany Frodo—now the Ring-bearer—in his quest. He also persuades
                Elrond to let Frodo's cousins Merry and Pippin join the Fellowship.
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking charge of the Fellowship (comprising nine representatives of the free peoples of Middle-earth,
                "set against the Nine Riders"), Gandalf and Aragorn lead the Hobbits and their companions south.
                After an unsuccessful attempt to cross Mount Caradhras in winter due to harsh conditions, they cross
                under the mountains through the Mines of Moria, though only Gimli the Dwarf is enthusiastic about that
                route. In Moria, they discover that the dwarf colony established there earlier by Balin has been
                annihilated by orcs. The Fellowship fights with the orcs and trolls of Moria and escape them.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, they encounter "Durin's Bane", a fearsome Balrog from ancient times.
                Gandalf faces the Balrog to enable the others to escape. After a brief exchange of blows, Gandalf breaks
                the bridge beneath the Balrog with his staff. As the Balrog falls, it wraps its whip around Gandalf's
                legs, dragging him over the edge. Gandalf falls into the abyss, crying "Fly, you fools!".
        
            <blockquote id="tribute-citation">
                The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the span, leaning on the staff in his left
                hand, but in his other hand Glamdring gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing him, and
                the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs whined and
                cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm. "You cannot pass," he said. The orcs stood
                still, and a dead silence fell. "I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You
                cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass."</br>

            <p>    
                Gandalf and the Balrog fall into a deep subterranean lake in Moria's underworld. Gandalf pursues the
                Balrog through the tunnels for eight days until they climb to the peak of Zirakzigil. Here they fight
                for two days and nights. In the end, the Balrog is defeated and cast down onto the mountainside. Gandalf
                too dies shortly afterwards, and his body lies on the peak while his spirit travels "out of thought and
                time".
